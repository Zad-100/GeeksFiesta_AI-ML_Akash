## Day 2
>> An excel data set was provided to us
>> We were asked to count the missing values, clean the data and describe the data
>> Counteed the missing values using .isnull().sum()
>> Cleaned the data as in : 1) renaming one unnamed column
                           2) removing the rows that were having missing/NaN values
                           3) changing the data type of a certain column to make it meaningfull
                           4) replacing anomalous values under each column by the median values of the same column
>> Described the data using .describe() and .info()
>> Also printed the mean, median and mode of the data frame seperately using the mean(), median() and mode() methods
>> Uploaded the folder for Day 2 on the GitHub repo
>> Updated this README file mentioning what all was done
